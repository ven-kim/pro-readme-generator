# Professional ReadMe Generator

# Description

This application was created in mind that as a user who is a developer, can use this README generator to quickly create a professional README for a new project. By using node and inquirer, I used the [Guide to a Professional README](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma/blob/main/readme-guide.md) as a reference so that the user can ensure that their README will match all the criterias necessary for introducing their project.
